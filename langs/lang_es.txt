A sunny and hot day,


ANYWAY, MAYBE WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR FOOD WITH GUGLI YOU WILL HAVE THE TIME TO LOOK AT THIS!


Aboard stand sailors trying to talk to you.


About this Esperia's Guild, I wonder about them, if I may speak frankly. There are rumours going around that they did some monstrous things and that they are hiding quite alot of things from us.
Sobre este Gremio de Esperia, me pregunto acerca de ellos, si me permite hablar con franqueza. Hay rumores de que hicieron algunas cosas monstruosas y que están ocultando un buen montón de cosas de nosotros.

También, había una inscripción en tu balsa, uno del gremio guerrero de Esperia, el gremio más extendido y más grande de todo el nuevo mundo. ¿Te hace recordar algo?

Also, we took your yayed clothes, as they were... Yeyeye... In a bad shape. Go check the chest near your bed, there are some other ones inside.#0

Orelse, if you feel capable, you can try killing Tortugas or Crocs if you're strong enough. I'm sure they could drop one or two @@.


Other than that, I don't know much about what else is going on, so directly asking the Cap'tain about it could be a good idea.


Our crew is like a family, and if you agree to help us, I would like to invite you to join our family!
Nuestra tripulación es como una familia, y si aceptas ayudarnos, ¡te invitare a unirte a nuestra familia!

Please don't tell people that you've seen me. I don't want to be thrown in the sea as food for sharks or decapitated. At least not again!


Please don't touch these hats, they are for crew members only.
Por favor no toques estos gorros, son solo para los miembros de la tripulación.

She is a good friend of mine... We wanted to marry a few weeks before her accident but...
Ella es una buena amiga mia... Nos queriamos casar unas semanas antes de su accidente...

She is the nurse and shipkeeper of this ship, and also an excellent chef!


She said that she will accept my application when Piou have teeth. It's just a matter of time, you see?
Ella dijo que aceptará mi solicitud cuando le salgan dientes a un Piou. Es sólo cuestión de tiempo, ¿lo ves?

She's on the upper level, yeye can't miss her. She's the only girl in this crew, oh well, except for you now yeyeye!


She's on the upper level, yeye can't miss her. She's the only girl in this crew.


Silvio starts to speak to his bottle, you leave the conversation.


So that's why we wanted to warn you, maybe he comes from that guild, as that sign was on his raft.
Así que por eso hemos querido avisarle. Tal vez él viene de ese gremio, debido al símbolo que estaba en su balsa.

So we are looking for some new merchandise that we could trade at our next destination.


So you finally woke up? We all thought you were in something like... You know, one of these long comas.


So, do you have anything for me today?
Asi que, ¿tiene algo para mi hoy?

So, how do you feel? I see that Julia did a marvelous job! You look like you're in good health now.
Entonces , ¿como te sientes? ¡Veo que Julia hizo un gran trabajo! Ahora parece que te encuentras mejor.

So, how is it going? Did you meet any other crew members yet?
Entonces, ¿cómo va? ¿Ya conociste a algún otro miembro de la tripulación?

So, what was I saying?
Así que... ¿qué estaba diciendo?

So, which good wind brought you here? Were you on your raft to meet me? Or because you've heard of my feats on Artis?
Así que... ¿Qué vientos te traen aquí? Estabas en tu balsa para conocerme? ¿O es porque ha oído de mis hazañas en Artis?

¡Lo siento! olvidé introducirme. Mi nombre es Arpan, pero los otros marineros me llaman Magic Arpan, porque sé una o dos cosas yaing hechizos mágicos.

Stupid yeye...


Suddenly, you hear a voice from the sky.
De repente, oyes una voz desde el cielo.

Sure, Cap'tain.
Seguro, Capit'án.

Sure, but Gugli needs my help first.


Sure, but what can you give me in exchange?


Sure, there is a reward for your task.


THAT'S A NICE NAME!


Take a Bandana.


Take these coins in exchange and be careful.


Thank you so much! Here, have some of my berries.
¡Muchas gracias! Mira, toma algunas de mis bayas.

Thank you, I'll take them.
Gracias, las tomaré.

Thanks again for helping me. But those Rattos are a permanent problem and your help is always welcome. The only problem is that I can give you a reward only one time.


Thanks for helping me!
¡Gracias por ayudarme!

That's right.
Eso es verdad.

That's where you go as well, right?

There are rumours going around that they did some monstrous things and that they are hiding quite alot of things from us.


There are some flying yellow plushes around you. They're called pious. Getting a roasted leg of one of them would be perfect.


There are some knifes on the table, do you want to take one?
Hay algunos cuchillos sobre la mesa, ¿quieres tomar uno?

There are still some Rattos left! Do you want to abort the quest?


There is a paper with some rules written on it.


There's nothing to say, don't worry miss.


There's nothing to say, don't worry sir.


These Croco Trees are full of yaying @@, but they are so hard to hit...


This girl is lucky we found her before a shark did. I have no idea where she comes from. By the way, did you see the logo on her raft?


This girl needs help, we need to rescue her!
La chica necesita ayuda, ¡debemos rescatarla!

This guy is lucky we found him before a shark did. I have no idea where he comes from. By the way, did you see the logo on his raft?


This guy needs help, we need to rescue him!


This is a light blue sea fruit, they're highly desired around the archipelago.


This is a nice place... There are some nice chicks...


This kind of talk should be punished, but I agree that I don't specially like them too, so keep an eye on her.
Éste tipo de habla debería ser castigada, pero concuerdo contigo en que especialmente no me gustan, así que mantén un ojo sobre ella.

We made a stop at a little island, before making it to the port of Artis.


We need as many hands as possible to explore the island out there, and to get some new food.
Necesitamos muchas manos para ayudar a explorar la isla, y para conseguir comida nueva.

We need manpower on the island.


We need manpower on the island... Oh forgive me, women are also welcome, of course.

We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you back in the sea, adrift on your raft.
Nosotros pensábamos que tú podrías ayudarnos a entender esto. Todo lo que sabemos es que te encontramos tirado en el mar, a la deriva en tu balsa.

We usually don't stop in such places, but the capt'ain let us stay here while he writes the location of this new island on his map!


We will be yaying there in a few days, so we will drop you off there.
