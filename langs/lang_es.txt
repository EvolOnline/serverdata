A Ground!


A Quiet place,


A Sunny and hot day,


A few moments ago, I heard your conversation with Darlin.


About this Esperia's Guild, I wonder about them, if I may speak frankly. There are rumours going around that they did some monstrous things and that they are hiding quite alot of things from us.
Sobre este Gremio de Esperia, me pregunto acerca de ellos, si me permite hablar con franqueza. Hay rumores de que hicieron algunas cosas monstruosas y que están ocultando un buen montón de cosas de nosotros.

About this Esperia's Guild, I'm not sure about them, frankly.

All that I had to eat were these berries... Berries... Berries...
Todo lo que tenía para comer eran estas bayas... Bayas... Bayas...

Alright, bye!
Muy bien. ¡Adiós!

Also, there was this inscription on your raft, one of the warrior guild of Esperia, the largest and biggest guild of the whole new world, does that make you remember something?
También, había una inscripción en tu balsa, uno del gremio guerrero de Esperia, el gremio más extendido y más grande de todo el nuevo mundo. ¿Te hace recordar algo?

Also, we took your yayed clothes, as they were... Yeyeye... In bad condition, go check the box around your bed, there is some new ones inside.#0
Así mismo, tomamos tus yayed ropas, como estaban... Yeyeye... En malas condiciones. Revisa la caja que está por aquí cerca de tu cama; dentro de allí hay otras.

And now I'm a sailor, as you can see!


And please, no berries.


And what kind of help do you need?
¿Y qué tipo de ayuda necesitas?

And you, how are you doing?


Anyway, maybe when you are looking for food with Gugli you'll have the time to look at this!!

As you open your eyes and look around, you see a large ship.
Al abrir tus ojos, y mirar en derredor, ves una enorme embarcación.

But I can't tell you anything about it, I'm sorry.
Pero no puedo decirte nada al respecto. Lo siento.

But I can't, I need to keep an eye on the sea, to warn the crew if there happen to be some pirates around!!


But I need to go, bye!


But for now, you can relax on the ship, or visit the island we're docked at! Its a small island, but a good place to get some exercise and stretch your legs.


But most important, she's the one who took care of you when you were in coma.


But who am I?
Pero, ¿quién soy yo?

But you won't *hick* me this time...
Pero tú no me has *hic* ganado esta vez...

Hehe, no. But I'm sure that a boy like you would like to meet a gentleman like me.


Hehe, no. But I'm sure that a lady like you would love to meet a charmer like me!
Jeje, no. Pero estoy seguro de que una dama como tú amaría conocer a un encantador como yo.

Hehe, sometimes he gets his head in the clouds, You should go ask him about that.
Jeje, algunas veces su cabeza se va por las nubes. Deberías ir y preguntarle acerca de eso.

Hehehe, he is a bit nervous, please excuse him, it's not everyday that we get a new member in the crew!
Jejeje, él está un poco nervioso, por favor discúlpelo. ¡No todos los días tenemos un nuevo miembro en la tripulación!

Hey you, sorry for leaving your room so quickly, I needed to... speak with the captain about... The reserve. You know, now that we got a new mouth to feed, we need to check what we have.


Hey! Be careful. You can't stay in this basement for so long, you're going to get sick. Come outside and take a break, maybe you can try again later.


Hey! Ehoo!!


Hey, don't worry about him, it's one of the first days in a long time that we can just chill out.
Oye, no te preocupes por él. Es uno de los primeros días en mucho tiempo en el que podemos sólo relajarnos.

Hey, girl!

It'll be a good time for you to do some exercise, the ship isn't big enough for that.

So, do you have anything for me today?

So, how is it going? Did you meet any other crew members yet?
Entonces, ¿cómo va? ¿Ya conociste a algún otro miembro de la tripulación?
