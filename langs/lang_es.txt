ANYWAY, MAYBE WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR FOOD WITH GUGLI YOU WILL HAVE THE TIME TO LOOK AT THIS!
¡DE TODOS MODOS, QUIZÁ CUANDO ESTÉS BUSCANDO COMIDA CON GUGLI TENGAS TIEMPO PARA MIRAR ESTO!

As they sailed on Oceania, great waters of Aemil, one of the groups found a land.


As you may know, we are long distance travelers and our whole crew needs to store enough food to survive. You don't know how dangerous the sea life can be.


As you open your eyes, you see a large ship before you.


Ask sailors around here they shouldn't be so far away.


Astapolos.


At this time, we were selling crab food on our old mushroom island.

No pasa nada, ¿tienes mas preguntas que hacerme?

No!
¡No!

No, I can't, I just wanted to travel across the seas for fun.
No, no puedo. Yo sólo buscaba navegar por diversión.

No, none.


No, sorry.


No, they are way too dangerous for me!
No, ¡son demasiado peligrosos para mi!

No.
No.

Nobody will know about the existence of the Mercurians.


Nobody! *burp*
¡Nadie! *eructo*

Nobody.


None of them?
¿Ninguno de ellos?

Not everybody has a kind mind. Scammers can be anywhere, even among us!


Not to kill your dream, but... Julia is mine!
No quiero matar tus sueños, pero... ¡Julia es mía!

Not yet. I will be back soon.


Nothing, just hanging around.
Nada, solo matando el tiempo.

Nothing, sorry.
Nada, lo siento.

Nothing.
Nada.

Now go outside and talk with Gugli, he'll tell you what we need.


OH, LOOK THERE!
¡OH, MIRA ALLÍ!

OH, OK!


ON THE TOP OF THE CLIFF!


Of course! Tell me which language you speak and I will change the note on the ship board list.
¡Por supuesto! Dime cuál idioma hablas y cambiaré la nota en la lista de embarque de esta nave.

Of course, they are on the left wall, go have a look at them.


Oh good! Did he give you your money back as well?
¡Oh, bien! ¿También te regresó tu dinero?

Oh look, there's a piou behind you!


Oh no, but I've noticed a weird light on the other edge of this island, I wonder what it can be...
Oh no, pero he notado una luz rara al otro lado de la isla, me pregunto qué sera...

Oh ok, I said nothing then.
Oh, ok. No dije nada, entonces.

Oh really? How could I forget a topic as important as that?
Oh, ¿en serio? ¡Cómo pude olvidar un punto tan importante como ese!

Oh really? I'll put some more foods on the next box then.


Oh well, we rescued you when you were yaying adrift in the sea.#0
Oh, bueno... te rescatamos cuando estabas yaying a la deriva en el mar.

Oh well. I'll also give you one of these hats from the box around you, but only after you complete your task!
Bueno, también te daré uno de estos sombreros de las cajas a tu alrededor. ¡Pero solo cuando termines tu tarea!

Oh yeyeye... As they are not edible, you can maybe try to equip them?#0


Oh yeyeye... As they are not edible, you can maybe try to equip them?#1


Oh! I like that sort of answer!


Oh, I was going to ask you if you wanted to help the crew search for some food and explore the island out there.


Oh, and I almost forgot! Do not give the password of your room to anybody! I am the only one who has the other key and I won't ask for yours so keep it secret and try not to use the same password for any other room in the future.


Oh, and Olga from the market place as well!
Oh, y Olga la del mercado también.

Oh, and give her some basic clothes, the poor girl, the one she had were in even worse condition that the ones we have!
Oh, y denle algunas ropas básicas, pobre niña, las que ella tenía están en peores condiciones que las que tenemos nosotros. 

Oh, and give him some basic clothes, the poor guy, the one he had were in even worse condition that the ones we have!
Oh y denle algunas ropas básicas al pobre hombre, ¡Las que el tenía están en peores condiciones que las que tenemos nosotros!

Oh, and there was this inscription on your raft. It represents one of the warrior guild of Esperia, the largest and biggest guild of the whole new world. Does that make you remember anything, anything at all?


Oh, he's still alive!
¡Oh, él aún está vivo!

Oh, it's you.
Oh, eres tú.

Oh, it's you. I think it is better we do not talk for a while. They suspect something.


Oh, not everything, don't worry, but your name came up at least twice in the conversation.


Oh, nothing important.
Oh, nada importante.

Oh, now that I remember, we've also found some money in your pockets, here it is!#0

Oh... Well, I just started to trade... Thus my technique may not be the best.


Ok, I think he's waking up, go see him.


Ok, I think she's waking up, go see her.


Ok, I will leave him alone.
Ok. Lo dejaré solo.

Ok, be patient a little while longer, in the next few days we will arrive at the port of Artis...
Ok, se un paciente un poco más. En los próximos días llegaremos al puerto de Artis...

Ok, done.

Other than that, I don't know much about what else is going on, so directly asking the Cap'tain about it could be a good idea.

So it seems I have another stomach to fill. Those bastards have no respect for who feeds them every damn day!


So rude. What is the reason behind your malice?


So that's why we wanted to warn you, maybe he comes from that guild, as that sign was on his raft.

Some Bandanas and Sailor Hats are inside this box.
Algunas bandanas y sombreros de marinero estan dentro de esta caja.

Some food.


Some more things are written down but it's not legible.
Hay más cosas escritas abajo pero no se pueden leer.

Sorry but I have no time for this.
Lo siento, pero no tengo tiempo para esto.

Sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Arpan, but other sailors call me Magic Arpan because I know one or two yaing magic spells.
¡Lo siento! olvidé presentarme. Mi nombre es Arpan, pero los otros marineros me llaman Magic Arpan, porque sé una o dos cosas yaing hechizos mágicos.

Sorry, I am not in the mood for another fight with those Rattos.


Sorry, I don't need any help right now. Come back later.


Sorry, but I can't tell you anything about that.


Stupid yeye...


Suddenly, you hear a voice from the sky.
De repente, oyes una voz desde el cielo.

Sure, but what can you give me in exchange?

Sure, there is a reward for your task.


Sure, why not?


THAT'S A NICE NAME!
¡ESE ES UN BONITO NOMBRE!

Take a Bandana.
Toma una bandana.

Take these coins in exchange and be careful.


Take this money for your wise choice. But do not try it again. Water has been merciful with you once... Do not tempt fate once more!


Tell him that everything went fine and that we're almost done with the food.


Thank you so much! Here, have some of my berries.
¡Muchas gracias! Mira, toma algunas de mis bayas.

Thank you, I'll take them.
Gracias, las tomaré.

Thanks again for helping me. But these Rattos are a permanent problem and your help is always welcome. The only problem is that I can give you a reward only one time.


Thanks for helping me!

Los elfos de la biblioteca se han inclinado por mí un tiempo atrás, así como Enora, del gremio guerrero.

The end of the story got erased, probably because of the sea water. Some pages are still missing thus you don't know the author's name.


The fear to see her sleeping on this quiet and lonely bed is becoming more and more unbearable, I think that I won't get the bravery to see her this time...
El miedo a verla dormir en esta cama silenciosa y tranquila se está volviendo más y más insoportable, no creo ser lo suficientemente valiente para verla esta vez...

The great people of Aemil split up into three groups when they reached the coast.


The hidden person doesn't answer.
La persona escondida no responde.

The old book seems to tell about the legend of Aemil. Would you like to read it?


The sailor chugs his beer.
El marinero resopla su cerveza.

The sailor turns his back to you.


The sailors take you aboard their ship.


The usurper has been punished! This is a great day, take this reward as a prize for your loyalty to the old commander!.


Their leaders then came to the conclusion that an alliance was the only way they could survive.


There are few groups of these @@'s all around this island. Just pick some and have a try.


There are rumors going around that they did some monstrous things and that they are hiding quite a lot from us.


There are some flying yellow plushes around you. They're called pious. Getting a roasted leg of one of them would be perfect.
Hay algunos peluches amarillos que vuelan a tu alrededor. Se llaman pious. Conseguir una pierna asada de uno de ellos sería perfecto.

There are some groups of these @@'s all around this island. Just pick some and have a try.


There are some knifes on the table. Would you like to take one?


There are still some Rattos left! Do you want to abort the quest?


There is a paper with some rules written on it.
Allí hay un papel con algunas reglas escritas en él.

There're 6 sailors who will need your help. They're all around the island.


There's nothing to say, don't worry miss.
No hay nada que decir, no se preocupe señorita.

There's nothing to say, don't worry sir.
No hay nada que decir, no se preocupe señor.

Therefore, starvation stroke on the people of Aemil.


These box are way too heavy to be brought alone onto the ship.


These crocotrees are full of yaying @@, but they are so hard to hit...


These yeye box are way too heavy to be carried alone onto the ship.


They are both valid and I need them. In the past, I probably did mistakes I now regret. I was wondering if you could investigate and... sort out this situation.


This girl is lucky we found her before a shark did. I have no idea where she comes from. By the way, did you see the logo on her raft?

Deberíamos estar allí en unos días, una vez que arribemos, voy a advertir al gremio de guerreros sobre lo que pasó, estoy seguro que pueden ayudar.

We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you back in the sea, adrift on your raft.
Nosotros pensábamos que tú podrías ayudarnos a entender esto. Todo lo que sabemos es que te encontramos tirado en el mar, a la deriva en tu balsa.

We usually dock around these small pieces of land because they provide us some of the best food of all the archipelago.


We usually don't stop in such splendid places, but the capt'ain let us stay here while he writes down the location of this new island on his map!


We will be yaying there in a few days, so we will drop you off there.
Estaremos yaying allí en unos dias, así que te dejaremos allí.

Well done! Collect all the ingredients and then come back here. You will be rewarded once they understand who rules this ship!


Well done! The ship is now ready to sail again!


Well, even though you have been rescued by us, it doesn't make you an expert sailor, am I right?


Well, thanks for the box. But... he was supposed to bring it back to me himself. I never asked him to give it to you!


Well... No wait, I have something for you but you shouldn't eat it... I'm taking it back to the kitchen.
