A Quiet place,


A Sunny and hot day,


A few moments ago, I heard your conversation with Darlin.


About this Esperia Guild, I'm not sure about them, frankly, there are rumors around that they did monstrous things and that they are hiding a lot of things from us.


About this Esperia's Guild, I wonder about them, if I may speak frankly. There are rumours going around that they did some monstrous things and that they are hiding quite alot of things from us.

Alright, bye!
Allé, 't e goe, salut!

Also, there was this inscription on your raft, one of the warrior guild of Esperia, the largest and biggest guild of the whole new world, does that make you remember something?
Ook, der woas een teken ip ui vlot, van de soldoat'n guild van Esperia, de grootste en zwoarste guild van de hele niewe wereld, doet ui da ergens an peiz'n?

But for now, you can relax on the ship, or visit the island we're docked at! Its a small island, but a good place to get some exercise and stretch your legs.

Other than that, I don't know much about what else is going on, so directly asking the Cap'tain about it could be a good idea.


Our crew is like a family, and if you agree to help us, I would like to invite you to join our family!

She is a good friend of mine... We wanted to marry a few weeks before her accident but...


She is on the upper level, yeye can't miss her. She is the only girl in this crew, oh well, except for you now yeyeye!
Z'es ip 't bovendek, yeye kunt ze nie miss'n. Z' ès 't enigste meiske bij de zeeman'n, wel, behalve gie nu, yeyeye!

She is on the upper level, yeye can't miss her. She is the only girl in this crew.
Z'es ip 't bovendek, yeye kunt ze nie miss'n. Z' ès 't enigste meiske bij de zeeman'n.

She is the nurse and the shipkeeper of this ship, and also an excellent chef!


She said that she will accept my application when Piou have teeth. It's just a matter of time, you see?


Silvio


Silvio starts to speak with his bottle, you leave the conversation.


So that's why we wanted to warn you, maybe he comes from that guild, as that sign was on his raft.
Doavor'n èn w' ui dus will'n woarschuw'n, misskien komt ie van die guild, omda da teken ip da vlot getekend was.

Doavor'n èn w' ui dus will'n woarschuw'n, misskien kom' ze van die guild, omda da teken ip da vlot getekend was.

So we are looking for some new merchandise that we could trade at our next destination.


So what's up?? What are you doing??


So you finally woke up? We all thought that you were in something like... You know, one of those long comas.


So, do you have anything for me today?


So, how do you feel? I see that Julia did a marvelous job! You look like you're in good health now.


So, how is it going? Did you meet any other crew members yet?
En, oe es 't gegoan? È je nog andere zeeman'n gezien?

So, what was I saying?


So, what's your name??


So, which good wind brought you here? Were you on your raft to meet me? Or because you've heard of my feats on Artis?


So, which good wind brought you here? Were you on your raft to meet my Julia? Or because you wanted to see the beautiful waitress' at Artis?


Some Bandanas and Sailor Hats are inside this box.


Some more things are written down but it's not legible.


Some other strings are added to this page.


Some sailors are trying to talk to you..
D'r zin en 'oop zeeman'n da me ui will'n klapp'n..

Sorry but I can't tell you anything about that.
Sorry, moar doar kanne 'k ik ui nieks over zegg'n.

Sorry but I have no time for this.
Sorry, moa 'k ei ier gin tid veure.

Sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Arpan, but other sailors call me Magic Arpan because I know one or two yaing magic spells.
Sorry! 'k è mi verget'n te presenter'n. Min noame es Arpan, moar d' andere zeeman'n noem'n mi Magischen Arpan, omda'k een of twee yaing magische spreuk'n kenne.

Sorry, I am not in the mood for another fight with those rattos.
Sorry, 'k é gin goestinge vo nog 'n gevecht met die rattos.

Suddenly, you hear a voice from the sky.
Plots hoor d' je en stemme van den 'emel.

Sure, Cap'tain.

Thank you so much! Here, have some berries...
merci, merci! 'ier, en poar beskes...

Thank you, I'll take them.
Merci, 'k goa da pakk'n.

Thanks again for helping me. But those rattos are a permanent problem and your help is always welcome. The only problem is that I can give you a reward only one time.
Merci vo mi 't 'elp'n. Moar die rattos bluv'n en probleem en ui'n ulpe es aolsan welkom. 't enigste probleem es da'k ui moar ene kje 'n beloninge kan gev'n.

Thanks for helping me!
Merci vo mi 't 'elp'n!

That's a nice name!!


That's right.


The door is closed.


The elven from the library has tilted on me a while ago, as well as Enora from the warrior guild.


The fear to see her sleeping on this quiet and lonely bed is becoming more and more unbearable, I think that I won't get the bravery to see her this time...


The giant boogeyman!


The sailor chugs his beer.


The sailor is turning his back to you.
De Zeeman es an 't wegdroai'n van gie.

The sailors take you aboard their ship to help you.
De zeeman'n droag'n ui ip 'un skip om ui 't 'elp'n.

There are some knifes on the table, do you want to take one?
D'er es en mes ip den tafel, wil dje 't pakk'n?

There are still some rattos left! Do you want to abort the quest?
Der zin nog oalsan wa rattos over! Wil d' je stopp'n me de missie?

There is a nice place to stay beside you.


There is a paper with some rules written on it.


There is nothing to say, don't worry miss.


There is nothing to say, don't worry sir.


There is some flying yellow plush around you, they're called pious. Getting a roasted leg of one of them would be perfect.
Der zin ier wa vliegende gele plushne dingskes rond gie, da noemt ne pious. Zo'n gebroad'n pootje van eentje zoe wel goe zin.

This girl is lucky that we found her before a shark did. I have no idea where this came from. By the way, did you see the logo on her raft?

This is a sea fruit, but some sea monsters may have them as well.


This kind of talk should be punished, but I agree that I don't specially like them too, so keep an eye on her.
Zuknen klap zoe moet'n bestraft weur'n, moar 'k ga akoord, ik è ze ook nie zo gèren, dus 'oud ze moar in de mot.

We are in need of manpower on the island.


We are in need of manpower on the island... Oh excuse me, women are also welcome!


We made a stop at a little island, before making it to the port of Artis.


We need as many hands as possible to explore the island out there, and to get some new food.


We should be there in a few days, once we arrive, I will warn the warrior guild about what happened, I'm sure they can help.


We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you back in the sea, adrift on your raft.
We peiden da je gie oes kost 'elp'n verstoan wa da 't er gebeurd ès, we wet'n oallènne da w' ui èn gevon'n in de zee, an't driv'n ip ui vlot.

You are on a raft, adrift in the sea.

You can attack a monster by clicking on it or from your keyboard you can press the A key to select the monster followed by 'Ctrl' to attack it.


You can't go there!
Ge kunt 'ier nie passer'n

You close your eyes a few seconds...


You could meet some of the other sailors this way, and... Getting this hat of course, will be a sign of you becoming part of our crew.


You don't remember anything before this.
Ge weet niks nie mjè wa da 't er vooraf ès gebeurt.

You have very bad amnesia.


You honor me beauty, but I'm already taken by Julia!


You like these hats, right?


You mentioned the quality of your wine


You need to walk north!!


You receive 25GP!


You see some items in the box. Take them out?
Ge zie wa ding'n in en dooze. 'oal dj'z'd'erut?

You see these Pious around?


You should go and get some sleep.
Ge zoe beter nog en bekke sloap'n.

You should go see them.
Ge zoe ze beter goan zien.

You should look at them once we arrive at the port, they are worth it, eheh.


You should try to kill some Tortugas, or some Croc if you're strong enough.


You still got a few days before we arrive at the port, maybe you can learn something from them?
G' eit nog en poar doag'n vo da w' arriver'n an den 'aven, misskiens kun dje entwuk leer'n van zudder?

You still haven't completed your task.


You stupid, he's english, look at the shape of the head.

You will see, citizens are polite and you can still ask for help in the warrior guild. They can help find a job for you or maybe help you find out what happened to you out at sea!


You're on a ship, we're on our way to the commercial capital of Artis.


You're right, it's about Julia.


You're right, it's about you.


You?? Here??
