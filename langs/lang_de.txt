About this Esperia's Guild, I wonder about them, if I may speak frankly. There are rumours going around that they did some monstrous things and that they are hiding quite alot of things from us.

All that I had to eat were these berries... Berries... Berries...


Alright, bye!
Ok, Tschüss!

Also, there was this inscription on your raft, one of the warrior guild of Esperia, the largest and biggest guild of the whole new world, does that make you remember something?


Also, we took your yayed clothes, as they were... Yeyeye... In bad condition, go check the box around your bed, there is some new ones inside.#0

Aber vorallem war sie es die sich um dich gekümmert hat während du im Koma lagst.

But until then, you need to stay here, there is nothing else to do anyway.

Could I ask you what your native language is? A sailor told me you're russian, but another one told me you're french... I'm a bit lost. I will register you on the ship boarding list just after that.

Hehe, sometimes he gets his head in the clouds, You should go ask him about that.
Hehe. Manchmal hat er seinen Kopf in den Wolken. Du solltest ihn danach fragen.

Hehehe, he is a bit nervous, please excuse him, it's not everyday that we got a new member in the crew!

Hallo, tut mir Leid, dass ich deinen Raum so schnell verlassen musste. Ich musste mit dem Kapitän über... deine Rettung. Naja wir haben nun ein weiteres Maul zu stopfen.

Hey, girl!

She is on the upper level, yeye can't miss her. She is the only girl in this crew.
Sie ist auf dem oberen Deck. Du kannst sie nicht verfehlen. Sie ist die einzige Frau in der Crew.

She is the nurse and the shipkeeper of this ship, and also an excellent cook!
Sie ist die Krankenschwester und Schiffsverwalterin, und auch eine exzellente Köchin

So that's why we wanted to warn you, maybe he comes from that guild, as that sign was on his raft.
Deswegen wollten wir dich warnen. Vielleicht kommt er aus der Gilde. Denn ihr Zeichen war auf dem Floß.

So, how do you feel? I see that Julia did a marvelous job! You look in good health now.


So, how is it going? Did you meet any other crew members yet?


Some sailors are trying to talk to you..
Ein paar Matrosen versuchen dich anzusprechen...

Sorry but I can't tell you anything about that.


Sorry but I have no time for this.
Tut mir Leid. Aber ich habe keine Zeit für sowas.

Sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Arpan, but other sailors call me Magic Arpan because I know one or two yaing magic spells.
Ah. Tut mir Leid. Ich habe vergessen mich vorzustellen. Ich heiße Arpan. Aber die meisten anderen Matrosen nennen mich Magic Arpan da ich den ein oder anderen Zauberspruch kenne.

The sailors take you aboard their ship to help you.

There are still some rats left! Do you want to abort the quest?


There is some flying yellow plush around you, they're called pious. Getting a roasted leg of one of them would be perfect.


There is some knifes on the table, do you want to take one?


This box is locked.

This girl is lucky that we found her before a shark did. I have no idea where this came from. By the way, did you see the logo on her raft?

Too bad that you do not want to help me.


We should be there in a few days, and once we arrive, I will advertise the warrior guild of what happened, I'm sure that they can help you. 


We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you back in the sea, adrift on your raft.


We tried to clean them but the sea water mostly killed them. It's why we gave you these cloths, they are not very good but it's all that we got.#0
