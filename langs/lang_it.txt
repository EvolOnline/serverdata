A few moments ago, I heard your conversation with Darlin.


About this Esperia Guild, I'm not sure about them, frankly, there are rumors around that they did monstrous things and that they are hiding a lot of things from us.

Alright, bye!
Bene, ciao!

Also, there was this inscription on your raft, one of the warrior guild of Esperia, the largest and biggest guild of the whole new world, does that make you remember something?
C'era anche un'iscrizione sulla tua zattera, una

And what kind of help do you need?
Che tipo di aiuto ti serve?

As you can walk around, it'll be easy for you. Impale one of them for me!!


As you open your eyes and look around, you see a large ship.

But for now, you can relax on the ship, or visit the island we're docked at! Its a small island, but a good place to get some exercise and stretch your legs.

Hehe, no. But I'm sure that a dude like you would like to meet a gentleman like me.


Hehe, no. But I'm sure that a lady like you would love to meet a charmer like me!


Hehe, sometimes he gets his head in the clouds, You should go ask him about that.

So you finally woke up? We all thought that you were in something like... You know, one of those long comas.


So, do you have anything for me today?


So, how do you feel? I see that Julia did a marvelous job! You look like you're in good health now.


So, how is it going? Did you meet any other crew members yet?
Allora, come va? Hai incontrato altri membri dell'equipaggio?

So, what was I saying?


So, what's your name??


So, which good wind brought you here? Were you on your raft to meet me? Or because you've heard of my feats on Artis?


So, which good wind brought you here? Were you on your raft to meet my Julia? Or because you wanted to see the beautiful waitress' at Artis?


Some Bandanas and Sailor Hats are inside this box.
Ci sono bandane e cappelli da marinaio qui.

Some more things are written down but it's not legible.


Some other strings are added to this page.


Some sailors are trying to talk to you..
Dei marinai stanno provando a parlarti...

Sorry but I can't tell you anything about that.
Scusa ma non posso dirti niente.

Sorry but I have no time for this.
Scusa ma non ho tempo.

Sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Arpan, but other sailors call me Magic Arpan because I know one or two yaing magic spells.
Scusa! Ho dimenticato di presentarmi. Mi chiamo Arpan, ma gli altri mi chiamano Magic Arpan perché conosco un paio di yay incantesimi.

Sorry, I am not in the mood for another fight with those rattos.
Scusa, ora non me la sento.

Suddenly, you hear a voice from the sky.
Improvvisamente senti una voce dal cielo.

Sunny and hot day,


Sure, Cap'tain.
Certo, Capitano.

Take a Bandana
Prendi una Bandana

Take a nap
Fatti un pisolino

Thank you so much! Here, have some berries...
Grazie mille! Ecco, un po' di bacche...

Thank you, I'll take them.
Grazie, li prendo.

Thanks again for helping me. But those rattos are a permanent problem and your help is always welcome. The only problem is that I can give you a reward only one time.
Grazie ancora del tuo aiuto, ma questi rattos sono un problema permanente, il tuo aiuto è sempre gradito. L'unico problema è che posso ricompensarti una volta sola.

Thanks for helping me!
Grazie dell'aiuto!

That's a nice name!!


That's right.


The door is closed.


The elven from the library has tilted on me a while ago, as well as Enora from the warrior guild.


The fear to see her sleeping on this quiet and lonely bed is becoming more and more unbearable, I think that I won't get the bravery to see her this time...


The giant boogeyman!


The sailor chugs his beer.


The sailor is turning his back to you.
Il marinaio ti da le spalle.

The sailors take you aboard their ship to help you.
I marinai ti caricano a bordo della nave per aiutarti.

There are some knifes on the table, do you want to take one?
Ci sono dei coltelli sul tavolo ne vuoi prendere uno?

There are still some rattos left! Do you want to abort the quest?
Ci sono ancora dei Ratto! Vuoi rinunciare?

There is a nice place to stay beside you.
C'è un bel posto per starti vicino.

There is a paper with some rules written on it.


There is nothing to say, don't worry miss.


There is nothing to say, don't worry sir.


There is some flying yellow plush around you, they're called pious. Getting a roasted leg of one of them would be perfect.
Ci sono dei pulcini che svolazzano in giro, si chiamano Piou. Una loro coscia arrostita sarebbe perfetta!

This girl is lucky that we found her before a shark did. I have no idea where this came from. By the way, did you see the logo on her raft?
Questa ragazza è fortunata che l'abbiamo trovata prima degli squali. Non so da dove venga. Comunque, hai visto il logo sulla sua zattera?

This girl needs help, let's rescue her!
Questa ragazza ha bisogno d'aiuto, salviamola!

This is a sea fruit, but some sea monsters may have them as well.


This kind of talk should be punished, but I agree that I don't specially like them too, so keep an eye on her.

Questo tipo di linguaggio andrebbe punito, ma sono d'accordo. Non piacciono nemmeno a me, tieni gli occhi aperti.

We are in need of manpower on the island.


We are in need of manpower on the island... Oh excuse me, women are also welcome!


We made a stop at a little island, before making it to the port of Artis.


We need as many hands as possible to explore the island out there, and to get some new food.


We should be there in a few days, once we arrive, I will warn the warrior guild about what happened, I'm sure they can help.


We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you back in the sea, adrift on your raft.
Pensavamo che potessi aiutarci tu a capirlo. Sappiamo solo che eri naufrago in mezzo al mare

We tried to clean them but the sea water mostly killed them. It's why we gave you these cloths, they are not very good but it's all that we got.#0
Abbiamo provato a pulirli ma l'acqua del mare li ha quasi distrutti. Ti abbiamo dato questi vestiti, non sono molto buoni ma è tutto quello che abbiamo.

Abbiamo provato a pulirli ma l'acqua del mare li ha quasi distrutti. Infatti ti abbiamo preso questi vestiti nuovi, non sono perfetti ma è tutto ciò che abbiamo.

We usually don't stop in such places, but Capt'ain let us stay here while he writes the location of this new island on his map!


We will be yaying there in a few days, so we will drop you off there.

You are now part of the crew! Thanks again for your help.
Sei parte dell'equipaggio! Grazie dell'aiuto.

You are on a raft, adrift in the sea.
Sei su una zattera. In mezzo al mare.

You are on our ship, we made port to a little island and we are actually yeyending our long merchant traveling adventure at the city of Artis.#0

You can attack a monster by clicking on it or from your keyboard you can press the A key to select the monster followed by 'Ctrl' to attack it.


You can't go there!
Non puoi andare la!

You close your eyes a few seconds...
Chiudi gli occhi per qualche secondo...

You could meet some of the other sailors this way, and... Getting this hat of course, will be a sign of you becoming part of our crew.


You don't remember anything before this.
Non ricordi nulla prima di questo.

You have very bad amnesia.


You honor me beauty, but I'm already taken by Julia!


You like these hats, right?


You mentioned the quality of your wine


You need to walk north!!


You receive 25GP!


You see some items in the box. Take them out?
Ci sono degli oggetti nella scatola. Vuoi prenderli?

You see these pious around? It seems that we are close to an island, we should take a look at the upper level.


You should go and get some sleep.
Dovresti andare a riposare.

You should go see them.
Dovresti andare da loro.

You should look at them once we arrive at the port, they are worth it, eheh.


You should try to kill some Tortugas, or some Croc if you're strong enough.


You still got a few days before we arrive at the port, maybe you can learn something from them?
Hai ancora qualche giorno prima che arriviamo al porto, magari puoi imparare qualcosa da loro?

You still haven't completed your task.


You stupid, he's english, look at the shape of the head.


You stupid, she's english, look at the shape of the head.


You told me that you 'were' important.


You tried to get rid of me, eeh?? But surprise! I'm still here...*hick* Or there....
Hai provato ad eliminarmi, eeh?? Ma sorpresa! Sono ancora qui... *hick* O lì...

You will see, citizens are polite and you can still ask for help in the warrior guild. They can help find a job for you or maybe help you find out what happened to you out at sea!


You're on a ship, we're on our way to the commercial capital of Artis.


You're right, it's about Julia.


You're right, it's about you.


You?? Here??
Tu??? Qui??
